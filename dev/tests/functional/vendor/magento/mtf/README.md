# Functional Testing Framework

The Functional Testing Framework (FTF) is an open source R&D project facilitating the improvement of Magento Core products. The Functional Testing Framework helps in avoiding duplication of test cases automated across the application utilizing data driven approach. With the new and improved Functional Testing Framework, developers will be able to automate functional testing of the developed functionality enabling frequent releases and higher product quality.

For more overview information refer to [Introduction to the Functional Testing Framework](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_introduction.html).

<h2>Step 1: Check your pre-installation conditions</h2>

Before installing the FTF, you will need to [configure Magento to prepare for testing](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_installation.html#mtf_install_pre_adj-magento), and [verify that required software is installed](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_installation.html#mtf_install_pre_tools). 
<h2>Step 2: Install the FTF</h2>

When you're ready, use [Composer to install the FTF](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_installation.html#mtf_install_perform).

<h2>Step 3: Verify your installation</h2>

[Verify that the FTF is installed](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_installation.html#mtf_install_check)  by checking your <code>dev/tests/functional/</code> directory to look for `vendor/magento/mtf`.

<h2>Step 4: Get Started with testing</h2>

For a fast-path option, see the [Quick start steps](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_quickstart.html). There you will learn how to [configure PHPUnit](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_quickstart/mtf_quickstart_config.html), [set up Selenium](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_quickstart/mtf_quickstart_environmemt.html) and [run functional tests](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/mtf/mtf_quickstart/mtf_quickstart_runtest.html).

<h2>Contributing to the Functional Testing Framework code base</h2>

Contributions can take the form of new components or features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes, optimizations, or just good suggestions.

To contribute to the FTF code base, you can use [general guides of Magento 2 contributing][1].
